                <h4> <strong>2. Balance high-yield ingredients with high-potency ingredients.</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    -Cucumbers, celery, and apples are juicing tsunamis; but
                    a little bit of ginger or mint goes a long way.
                    Be aware of the behavior of each ingredient in the juicer
                    (which will be immediately apparent when you've
                    juiced it once), and try to maintain a reasonable balance
                    between flexible, mellow ingredients and more intense ones.
                    Spinach, leaf of kale, cucumber, peeled half lemon, one apple
                    and small carrot, sieve it and your juice is ready. This blend
                    makes incredible detoxifier with a powerhouse of anti-oxidant
                    and anti-iflammatory properties.<br>
                    -Apples make for a great juice ingredient as they have a sweet
                    flavour and help mask other flavours. To make this juice combine
                    2 apples, 1 peeled lemon, 3 stalks of celery, 2 carrots (peeled),
                    and 5 stems of fresh parsley. Celery is low in calorie and a good
                    source of fibre, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin K. Lemon is also
                    an effective cleansing agent which makes this blend of juice healthy.

                        -In many cases, leaving the skin on the produce you juice is
                        just fine-even pineapple skin can roll just fine through most
                        decent juicers. Especially if you're using the skin, do be sure
                        to buy produce grown with organic practices when possible.<br>
                        -A few exceptions, where you should peel:<br>
                        *Kiwis<br>
                        *Produce that's been waxed<br>
                        *Citrus fruits, if you want the pure taste of the juice without
                        the skin's oil and the pith's bitterness<br>
                        *Any other ingredient where you're concerned the skin will affect
                        the taste (for example, you might do a taste test with melons,
                        though it's technically fine to juice the skins)<br>
                        *And, if you're visually astute or serving to a crowd, any peel
                        that might negatively affect the color of the final juice

                        <h4> <strong>4. Fibre is the key problem</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            Juicing releases the sugars in fruit and removes the insoluble fibre;
                            blending also releases the sugars and tears apart the insoluble fibre.
                            Most of the sugar in fruit is fructose, which can only be processed by the liver.
                            A small amount of fructose, in an apple for example, does us no harm because we consume it
                            along with
                            the fibre. Fibre protects us against the effects of fructose by slowing its absorption,
                            and also makes us feel full. Fruit juice, on the other hand, is absorbed immediately, like
                            all sugary
                            drinks, as the fibre has been removed.

                    <p>
                        The scientist agree that juice is an important sources of nutrients for people
                        One hundred per cent fruit juice makes a valuable contribution to our intake of vitamin C in the
                        UK diet, contributing almost 20% to average daily vitamin C intake in schoolchildren, and more
                        than 10% in adults, she says. 'A 150ml glass of unsweetened orange juice is also a source of
                        folate and potassium.
                        naturally agrees, arguing that just 8.5% of UK children and 30% of adults eat the five
                        recommended portions of fruit or vegetables a day. Gaynor Ferrari, a spokeswoman for the
                        Association, says "scaremongering" is overshadowing the positive contribution that fruit juice
                        makes to the nations health. Sensible dietary advice should be encouraging everyone -
                        especially those struggling to reach their 5-a-day

                    -The way food looks affects our perception of the way it tastes.
                    The same applies at least equally to juices (and smoothies).
                    Don't make a grey juice or a brown one unless you have an opaque
                    cup with a lid or a penchant for the grotesque. Pair intelligently.<br>
                    -In a green juice, for example, apples and pears make better sweeteners
                    than strawberries. If you're really stuck, just juice a beet.
                    It's the ultimate color trump card and will override almost anything.<Br>
                    -The earliest juice is virtually clear, while late-harvest juice has
                    that familiar deep-orange color of carton juice. Though color doesn't
                    necessarily have anything to do with taste or sweetness, manufacturers
                    of carton juice (like Tropicana) try to ensure their juice always looks
                    the same.
